# HealRPG

This will be a game which simulates the experience of an MMORPG healer.
You will have access to a number of spells and buffs that work in different
ways. You will fight against one or more enemies. Your allies (tanks and
DPS) will fight automatically on their own; your job is to keep them alive.
Really, the bulk of the game is a lot of health bars and a few spells
that you can use to try and keep them alive.

I'm writing it mostly to pick up on Angular 2.
Eventually I intend to give it some type of backend (node, maybe? Python?).
I don't want to do a Java backend, it's too clumsy and annoying. This will
permit game saves. Now I think about it, it's kind of dumb that I'm
doing this client/server side when it's all intended to be local. Ah well,
whatever, it's just for learning anyways.
